### [Survey](https://github.com/language-shprt/LEGO_Project/tree/main/QUESTIONNAIRE)

This is a program that takes four Google Forms questionnaires in different languages, creates language keys and ID for each respondent, cleans the data set, checks city names using regular expressions, changes Czech, Russian and Polish letters to Latin symbols, transforms answers into numbers based on the mapping scheme, saves answers to open-ended questions, returns total count of multiple choice questions (pandas), and compiles a consolidated dataset that is ready for visualization and analysis

### [Web Scraping](https://github.com/language-shprt/LEGO_Project/tree/main/SCRAPING)

This is a script to parse the page brickeconomy.com. It returns themes, names, retail prices and rating for 4.5K LEGO sets. It doesn't work with pagination (returns first 50 items from each list).
